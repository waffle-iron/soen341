SOEN 341 project

## Introduction
Our project is a hyperlocalized chatroom which will allow people in the same classroom to 
be able to exchange thoughts and ideas about the current lecture together. For example, this
will allow people to share images of a whiteboard for students further back who aren't able to 
see or for someone to explain a concept to students who aren't able to understand. We will also 
be adding the ability for teachers to moderate the chatrooms and to be able to 
start and stop the chatroom whenever they feel it is necessary to do so.
